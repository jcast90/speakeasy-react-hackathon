        "Your iPhone can now feed you. No, your phone hasn’t learned to cook but you won’t have to either, thanks to the free, easy-to-use Eat24 Order Food Delivery & Takeout app.\n\nOrder food delivery from over 40,000 restaurants in 1,500+ cities, with more being added each day. Search 24 hours a day from wherever you are, or wherever you’re going to be when you’re ready for some food. The Eat24 app remembers your preferences, which saves you time, and gives you coupons on a regular basis, which saves you money. Oh, and because 24 is in our name, that means you can definitely order 24 appetizers for yourself and not feel the least bit bad about it. At least we're pretty sure that's how it works.\n\nWhat can our app do?\n- Search for specific cuisines, restaurants...even particular dishes.\n\n- It has Yelp inside. See what the foodies of Yelp think about a restaurant without leaving the app.\n\n- Eye Candy. Eat with your eyes and browse delicious food photos on the restaurant menu page. As if you weren’t hungry enough already.\n\n- In unfamiliar territory? Search by your current location, order, and the Eat24 app will have it waiting (well, really the restaurant will, but you get the idea).\n\n- Like to play favorites? We understand completely (Mom always liked us best). The Eat24 app lets you save your favorite restaurants so you can find them more easily next time.\n\n- Using filters to sort by distance, newest, top rated, delivery/pickup. Plus sort by personal preferences like spicy, healthy, and more. \n\n- Do you enjoy entering your credit card numbers over and over again? That’s a rhetorical question, no one does. Which is why the Eat24 app lets you scan your credit card directly into the app and securely stores your payment information for you.\n\n- Hate credit cards? Use Apple Pay or PayPal!\n\n- 24 Hour Live chat and order status support. If it isn’t right, we’ll make it right. No robots, no problem.\n\n- Cash back for future orders through our CashCoupon rewards system.\n\n- Exclusive offers and content through our Eat24Hours VIP program.\n\n- Eat24 Notes. Write a note about your meal right on your phone and remind yourself to order/not order an item again. (Because hunger affects memory in mysterious ways)\n\n- We added the popular Tweet My Meal function, because everyone knows that if you didn’t tweet about it, it didn’t actually happen.\n\nBest of all, once your order’s in, Eat24 handles every aspect of the delivery experience. Which means no more screwed-up orders. No more wondering where the delivery driver is. Just the ability to take back a few precious minutes of your day and enjoy. Something not quite right? Hit up our 24 Hours Live Support within the app and chat with a real human being about any issue or question you may have. We’ll make things right.\n\nTap, Relax and Enjoy with the Eat24 app in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington DC, Miami, Baltimore, Las Vegas, Boston, Chicago, New York City, San Diego, Houston, Denver, Atlanta, Phoenix, Austin, Philadelphia and almost every other U.S. city, with more being added every day",

Thoughts cause physical feelings and emotions which cause actions. Pacifica helps break this cycle using tools that target each of its components. Day-by-day, you'll learn to manage stress, anxiety and depression at your own pace. We’re not about quick-fixes or false promises. We are about real progress, a day at a time.\n\n#1 - BuzzFeed's Amazing Apps For Anyone Living With Anxiety\n#1 - Forbes' 4 Technologies Innovating in Mental Health\n\nTESTIMONIALS\n\n\"This app is not only beautiful and easy to use, it's also an incredibly useful tool that has genuinely changed my way of thinking when it comes to anxiety.\"\n\n“Thank you so much for improving my quality of life. I suffer from depression and generalized anxiety disorder and your app helps me SO much!...I know I can do better and Pacifica motivates me to improve my eating habits (and to drink more water and less alcohol and coffee!).”\n\nRELAXATION & MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AUDIO TOOLS\nCalm down in moments of stress or anxiety using one of Pacifica’s 30+ audio exercises set to relaxing soundscapes, including deep breathing, muscle relaxation, mindfulness meditations, and more.\n\nGUIDED SELF-HELP PATHS\nOur psychologist-designed Paths include audio lessons and helpful activities to help you with stress, anxiety, or depression. These include an introductory Path, two Paths focused on CBT, and a mindfulness Path.\n\nMOOD TRACKER\nRate your mood and feelings throughout the day, and add specific notes (the situation, the trigger, etc.) so you can notice patterns and see improvement over time. \n\nTHOUGHT RECORDING, JOURNALING & ANALYSIS\nUse Pacifica’s psychologist-designed thought analysis tools to learn how distorted thinking patterns contribute to your anxiety. Pacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to think in a more balanced way, which helps break the negative thought cycle.\n\nDAILY CHALLENGES & GOAL TRACKING\nPacifica uses CBT techniques to help you to face your anxiety, one day at a time, and gradually work toward your long term goals via daily challenges.\n\nHEALTH TRACKER\nSet and track daily health goals for habits that affect anxiety (exercise, sleep, caffeine, alcohol, etc.). Learn which of these trigger your anxiety based on patterns in your mood. Exercise, sleep and caffeine can also be populated using the Apple Health app.\n\nCOMMUNITIES & GROUPS\nYou aren’t alone in this. Share stories, advice and more with Pacifica’s peer-support community.\n\nPRICING & TERMS\nPacifica is free to download and use.

        "Feeling lonely or bored in 2017 is nonsense! There are 8 billion people in the world. Surely, there is a like-minded person who'd love talking to you right now. Dive into the world of Wakie and find the right person to talk to right away!\n\nWakie is the social app for phone calls. Ask questions to strangers who know answers, get advice. Socialize when bored, express feelings, meet new people.\n\nNow, you can create any topic you want to discuss and get matched with someone who would make a good conversation partner. That person could be anyone in the world, as long as you speak a common language! \n\nTopics can be anything, from lighthearted subjects like “I want to practice Spanish with a native speaker” or “Where’s the best surfing in the world?” to more serious questions such as, “I’m having trouble getting through to my children and could use some advice.”\n\nWithin seconds, Wakie will dial you into a phone call with someone interested in responding to your topic.\n\nPeople all over the world are on Wakie, so it’s a great way to learn about other cultures, talk to locals when traveling, and just get new perspectives on life. \n\nWe, the Wakie team, are online pretty often and we’d love to talk to you and keep making Wakie smarter and happier.\n\nLet us know what you think in the “Send Feedback” section.\n\nSincerely yours,\nThe Wakie Team",

        "SAM is a friendly app that offers a range of self-help methods for people who are serious about learning to manage their anxiety.\n\nSAM has been developed by a university team of psychologists, computer scientists and student users. Established methods of self-help have been combined with high standards of usability to provide an engaging, flexible, and practical resource.\n\nThe key features of SAM are:\n\n• Clearly laid out menus\n• User guidance\n• External links\n• Self-monitoring of anxiety with graphical display\n• 25 self-help options covering: Information about anxiety, Thinking and anxiety, Physical relaxation, Mental relaxation, Health and Anxiety\n• Guidance on putting self-help into practice\n• Closed social network of SAM users\n\nThe content of SAM is presented in various media formats in order to support users in learning about anxiety and practicing self-help.

        "This is the stop smoking app that science built. Over 20 different, evidence-based, techniques to help you become - and stay - smoke free.  See how much money you've saved, how many cigarettes you've not smoked, how long you’ve been smoke free, how much life you've regained and how your health is improving. \n\nLog your cravings, get tips on dealing with them, use the map to see where they congregate, the notes to see what patterns can be identified and the graph to see how they're decreasing. \n\nAll this is free to use and entirely free of ads. If you need extra help giving up smoking our missions could be just what you need, as they’ve been proven to double your chances of quitting. No other app can promise you this.\n\nWe proved the missions worked by performing a rigorous scientific experiment. As far as we know, this is the first ever randomised control trial run entirely within an app. Its success means we want to run many more and our goal is to constantly make our app more effective\n\nThis is all entirely voluntary and you can download the app without taking part in the experiment. Your data will be kept anonymous and you can delete it at any time. But we really hope you do take part because everyone who does will help the quitters who follow. So do yourself a favour by quitting smoking. And do your fellow smokers a favour by helping them understand how it’s done.",

        "***** (5/5)  \"Word Wow is an explosion of thought-provoking, perplexing, and thrilling fun for almost all ages.\" - AppAdvice\n\nWord Wow is a word game where you make words to dig deeper into the ground. As you dig down, Worm will follow until you can guide him to the bottom before time runs out. You need to be able to make words quickly to string together bonuses, as well as just to clear the path.\n\nIf you find Worm to be stuck and you can't come up with any words, you can use a bomb to clear some of the tiles. You have a limited number of bombs, but you can earn more as you make more words. As Worm moves down the board, more letters become available.\n\nEach level has at least 1 hidden gem, and if you can find all the gems in all the levels of a world, a bonus level is opened where you can really rack up the points!\n\nThe bigger the words that you can make the more points you'll earn. Try and make enough points each level to earn all three stars.\n\nWord Wow will sharpen your brain as well as your reflexes.    Help a worm out! \n\nFeatures: \n* 140,000 word dictionary \n* Fast action with the timer or relaxed mode without it\n* 140 Levels and 7 distinct worlds \n* Bonus level for each world when  you collect all the gems\n* Lots of replay value as you try to compete with others in Game Center",

        "*** One of the best educational apps of the year - Apple (iTunes Rewind) ***\nNow you can learn to speak & read Spanish, all by playing games on the go. With 9 addictive games designed for essential vocabulary & conversation skills, MindSnacks’ Spanish app is perfect for adults, kids, students or globetrotters visiting any Spanish-speaking country.\n\nBy playing rich and engaging games instead of flipping tedious flashcards, you’ll actually enjoy learning our app’s 1000+ Spanish vocab words. And with specific lessons to help learn -AR, -IR and -ER verbs as well as conjugation, you’ll be shooting the breeze in Español before you know it.\n\nDownload the first lesson totally free. If that’s not enough, upgrade to get all 50 lessons and additional side quests for up to 40 hours of content and give your vocabulary a total body workout, Spanish-style.\n\n* PRESS *\n\nUSA Today\nOne of the top-three iOS apps that “make the process of learning new words fun.”\n\nTeachers With Apps \n“As students explore and practice...they devour Spanish words and phrases that are clearly and distinctly enunciated with audio clips from native speakers!”\n\nApp Safari\n\"This app is not just your average, run-of-the-mill crash course... It includes complex exercises, challenges, and lessons that make the learning process fun and effective.\"\n\n* FEATURES * \n\n-- 9 addictive and unique games\n-- 1000+ Spanish words & phrases to study and master\n-- Spoken audio clips provided by a native Spanish speaker to help with pronunciation\n-- Hand-illustrated image library to help memorize words\n-- 50 Spanish lessons designed by Ivy League instructors (upgrade required)\n-- Personalized learning algorithms to maximize memorization, retention & contextual usage\n-- Enhanced review mode lets you replay previously mastered lessons\n-- Additional quests & challenges will keep you motivated\n-- Not a single tedious, boring, mind-numbing or snooze-inducing quiz, class or lesson allowed\n\n* WHAT OUR (SUPER AWESOME) FANS HAVE TO SAY *\n\n“I highly recommend this to those of you that want a quick, easy, and on-the-go way to learn Spanish!”\n\n“I recently stumbled upon MindSnacks as an app for use with my students who are learning Spanish. What a gem! The game-based structure makes learning fun and exciting while also being motivational.”\n\n“I just downloaded how to speak Spanish and ended up getting all the languages because it’s so easy and it is a great way to learn new languages. It's fun too!”\n\n* THE SCIENCE BEHIND MINDSNACKS *\n\nAt MindSnacks we like to keep it fun, but we’re serious about learning. That’s why our Spanish app includes 9 challenging games designed by Ivy League professors. Each game teaches a specific aspect of the language, creating a well-rounded learning experience for both kids and adults that goes far beyond basic vocabulary flashcards. \n\nOf course studying is only worth it if it works, so our unique algorithm reinforces the learning process using proven methods from the field of memory studies. Over time, the games adapt to your individual performance, selectively repeating Spanish words, phrases and grammatical points with which you’ve previously struggled. In other words, as you learn Spanish, the app learns about you for a more effective learning experience. \n\nPerfect for beginning and intermediate learners of Latin American Spanish, MindSnacks is like your own personal Spanish teacher you can take just about anywhere . You’ll quickly become less reliant on that Spanish dictionary and learn the grammar and vocab needed for traveling in Spain or other Spanish-speaking countries. \n\n* SUPPORT *\n\nFor more information or support, please contact us at support@mindsnacks.com.

        "Have you ever been in a situation where you question whether it’s dangerous enough to call 911? Instead of worrying yourself with indecision, use SafeTrek. SafeTrek uses advanced technology to get emergency help to your exact location with just the release of a button. It can be used in moments where you simply feel unsafe, as well as moments where you need immediate emergency help.\n \nHere’s how simple it is: Press and hold the button whenever you feel uneasy. Release the button when you have reached your home, car, or a safe destination and enter your 4-digit pin. In danger? Simply release the button and do not enter your pin. Your local police will be notified of your location and emergency.\n \nOther SafeTrek Features\n     • Prefer texting? If you can’t talk in an emergency, you can still communicate with us via text.\n     • Can’t text or talk? No worries, we’re still sending police to your exact location.\n     • On the move? We update your location even if you’re in a taxi, bus, running, or walking.\n     • In a panic? You can use 3D Touch to trigger a silent alarm from your home screen.\n     • On-call team works 24/7/365 to get you the help you need, when you need it.\n     • In-app profile allows you to communicate important information before the fact, so emergency services are up to speed.\n     • First month is free, so you can make sure SafeTrek is right for you!\n \nWhat do real SafeTrek users say about it:\n     • “I have no doubts that this app will save a life one day”\n     • “In short, this is an app you want on your phone and everyone's phone that you love. Real deal. No gimmicks. Just reliable safety when you need it the most.”\n     • “It was such a relief to have access to SafeTrek at the touch of a button. It makes me feel safe even when I am alone.”\n \nSafeTrek only works if you have a subscription. In order to cover the cost of our 24/7 call centers that ensure your safety, SafeTrek charges a small monthly fee of $2.99. Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase, and will automatically renew unless you cancel your account at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription month. Subscriptions may be managed by the user and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to the user's Account Settings after purchase. No cancellation of the current subscription is allowed during active subscription period.\n \nSafeTrek's Terms of Use: https://www.safetrekapp.com/terms\nSafeTrek's Privacy Policy: https://www.safetrekapp.com/privacy\n \nNote: Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life. SafeTrek will only use your GPS location in the background if you have an active alert.",
